                    The summer before my senior year of undergrad, I went to London. This trip was my semi-impulsive, first international 
                    trip without my parents. My sister and I had been talking about traveling together for years, and after realizing that I didn't know 
                    where I would be after graduation, we thought that it was now or never to take this opportunity. This trip truly inspired what this website is all about!

                    After a 6 hour red-eye flight from Boston to London, we arrived in London-Heathrow Airport. 
                    After being so exhaused from travelling, my sister took a break in the airport chairs before
                    figuring out how to ride the London Tube for the first time. It was surprisingly easy and very 
                    reliable. My sister and I took turns napping and clutching onto our luggage during the hour-long train ride.

                    We ended the night at a restaurant in Battersea Power Station called Cinammon Kitchen. It was my 
                    first time trying Indian food and I loved it. The owner was very nice and the food was very accommodating
                    to my allergies. My sister and I still talk about this place on a regular basis.

                    and having aerial views of the city and the Thames River.

                    but one of the most famous places to eat at the market is the pulled pork sandwich stand called "The Black Pig." We also tried the famous 
                    chocolate covered strawberries and walked around to see all the different food stalls. Overall, it was a great experience with many

                    After lunch, we went to Sky Garden, a public garden located at the top of the "Walkie Talkie" building. 
                    The views of London from up there were incredible, and we took lots of photos with the city skyline in the background.
                    On our way back, we stopped by Leadenhall Market, a beautiful covered market with shops and restaurants. This 
                    was also where some scenes from the Harry Potter movies were filmed!
