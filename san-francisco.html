                    San Francisco was a quick long weekend trip with my sister and unexpectedly some of my 
                    family I haven't seen in many years. I actually went to San Francisco for a concert but it 
                    ended up being one of my shortest and most hectic trips because of everything I did. Try to 
                    guess who I went to see before it's revealed at the end of this post!

                    I flew from Seattle to San Francisco on Friday. Since this was a relatively short flight, the plane was a bit smaller 
                    and since I was sitting in the exit row, I had so much leg room! Before fully leaving Seattle, I got to see Mt. Rainier which 
                    is pretty rare since the sky needs to be very clear to see it. After landing, my mom was gracious enough to pick me up and drive me to 
                    the hotel my sister and I were staying at. Coincidentally, she was visiting her sisters and mom in. Sacramento that same weekend so we got to 
                    meet up. We ate some Chipotle, caught up, and waited for my sister to arrive from her flight.

                    The next day, my sister and I explored a bit of San Francisco before our concert that night. We first got coffee at a local 
                    coffee shop called Karma Coffee. The interior was very unique and vibrant which I felt reflected the aesthetic of San Francisco

                    After our caffeine fix, we walked around Haight-Ashbury, the famous neighborhood known for its history with the 1960s 
                    counterculture movement and unique shops. We walked around and explored many vintage stores. My favorite store was this shop that 
                    had a variety of different vintage photobooths. My sister and I spent way too much money but I love to collect photobooth strips from 
                    different places I visit. We also stopped by a taco shop for a quick lunch.

                    After lunch, we tried a popular boba chain called Boba Guys and it was honestly the best boba I've ever had in my life. I got my usual 
                    mango green tea and would buy again in a heartbeat. The boba shop was close to the iconic Painted Ladies houses so we walked over there 
                    to take some pictures. I love the architecture of these houses and the vibrant colors of the city.

                    We shuttled back to the hotel to get ready for the concert that night. We went to see Sabrina Carpenter live at Crypto Arena! 
                    (Did you guess right?) I've been a fan of her since I was young so it was great to be able to see one of my favorite artists 
                    It was such a fun experience seeing her live and dancing along to all her songs. My favorite song she sang was Sharpest Tool where 
                    she had a bathroom set that had a mirror connecting to a camera projected on the screen.
